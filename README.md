# NAND
NAND is a simple DSL I made as a proof of concept to myself.
The language only supports assignments and NAND operations.
If you find it interesting, go ahead and do the following to get started.
```
git clone https://github.com/MichaelSnowden/nand
cd nand
mvn generate-sources
```

After doing that, run the REPL class to be presented with a simple read-eval-print-loop.
